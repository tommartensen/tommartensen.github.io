          Reduce administrative work in patient examination during ward rounds and enable patients to understand
          procedures and outcomes based on data.

        <ul class="circle-list">
          <li><strong>Misdiagnoses</strong> affect up to <em>12 million Americans/annum</em>, half of those can be
            considered <strong>harmful</strong> <a class="source" href="#sources">[1]</a></li>

            Given advancement in <strong>personal assistants</strong> such as Siri, Alexa or Google Home, we consider
            speech-to-text a solved problem.
            However, such language models may have to be <strong>re-trained for medical purposes</strong>.
            We propose a semi-supervised approach here.

            <strong>Named-Entity recognition</strong> in particular in the medical field is the topic of ongoing
            research.
            However, as hyperscalers such as <a

            tap into the field of natural language processing for medical texts, productive systems seem to be on the
            horizon.

          <li>
            Any solution must have an <strong>interface to the clinical information system</strong> used at the hospital
            to insert and retrieve information.
            While there is a multide of different vendors, <strong>co-innovating</strong> with one of them may pioneer
            the solution.
